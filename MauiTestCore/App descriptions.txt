Why the declaration of the viewmodel in App.cs ?
The full application is very complexe and many values in many viewmodels are used to the contentpages, contentview and / or other viewmodels.
To make sure that we retrieve the values in the code behind of the pages (in many cases with collectionview selectionchanged) we declared all viewmodels in app.cs

Current bugs in the application:
1. The viewmodel values change properly but nothing happen in the user interface,
2. The user interface change sometimes when *** happens.
3. Some svg declared as MauiImages are displayed sometimes when *** happens

*** -- For example when the windows is pushed full screen. -- 

This goes everywhere in the application.

A short video has been provide to showcase the bugs.
